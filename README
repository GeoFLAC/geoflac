==========
Compile
==========

$ cd src
$ make F90=<f90 compiler>

This will generate a binary "flac".

Supported compilers:
gfortran -- GNU (default), v4.2 or later, otherwise openmp is disabled
ifort    -- Intel
pgfortran-- PGI, the only compiler for openacc
f90      -- Sun Studio (less tested)

The default is to build optimized binary with openmp. Several command line
options can build other type of binaries.

debug=1    -- debugging binary (detecting various coding errors at runtime)
omp=0      -- disable openmp
acc=1      -- enable openacc on nvidia gpu
coverage=1 -- code coverage analysis (only for gfortran)
gprof=1    -- profiling

E.g. to make a debugging binary
$ make debug=1


==========
Run
==========

To run the provided example input, execute following commands:
$ cd geoflac/examples
$ rm *.0 sys.msg                           # delete old output files
$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=<# of CPU cores>  # you can skip this step if using ALL
                                           # available CPU cores
$ ../src/flac subduction.inp

To restart a model from previous output, execute following commands:
$ mv _contents.save _contents.rs
$ ../src/flac subduction.inp

The description of input parameters can be found in doc/ directory.


==========
Plot
==========

$ ../util/flac2vtk.py .

This will generate a series of VTK files (*.vts), which can be visualized by
several programs, e.g. ParaView, or LLNL's VisIt.
